An overly complex hello world. 

The rules are simple:

1. The ONLY thing the app can do is print "Hello World" to the console.
2. Everything added must ultimately support this goal.
3. Additional functionality can be added for the sake of completeness. 
	For example, the ViewList can have methods such as pop() and shift() etc, since this would make it a fully functional class with expected behaviors.
